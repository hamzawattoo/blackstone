Overview
# Secure Login Form

This project is a secure login form built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Vue.js 3. It efficiently handles user authentication and validation with the help of GitHub Copilot. The visual design and layout were initially drafted using Figma to ensure a seamless user experience.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The form layout is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes using Tailwind CSS.
- **Form Validation**: Real-time feedback on user inputs, implemented with the help of GitHub Copilot.
- **User Authentication**: Basic authentication logic is built into the Vue component to validate login credentials.
- **Figma Wireframes**: Wireframes designed in Figma to plan the UI layout and user experience before development.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the login form.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the form and ensuring it is mobile-responsive.
- **Vue.js 3**: For dynamic handling of the form, validation logic, and managing component state.
- **GitHub Copilot**: Assisted in writing validation and authentication logic for efficient form processing.
- **Figma**: Used to create wireframes and design mockups for the login page before development.
